# Sign Language Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing sign language gestures from video or image data. The model is trained on a dataset of hand gestures representing different sign language characters or words.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to recognize sign language gestures using machine learning. The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify hand gestures into different categories representing sign language characters or words.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves several steps including data augmentation, normalization, resizing, and label encoding.
